This Repository contains various projects I completed during my time 
at UTSA. The projects are sorted by the semester they were completed in. 

This serves more as an archive for code I've written and every program shown
has compiled and been ran before being submitted. However I have not adapted the code
to be cloned and run hassle-free from github. To test the code, clone the 
specific project folder and run it with gcc or eclipse depending on the language.

Cloning a specific folder from this repository is referred to as a "Sparse Checkout".
A tutorial on how to do so can be found via your preferred web browser.
